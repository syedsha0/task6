Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

 #Objective
To understand what makes a password strong and to evaluate different password complexities using free online password strength checkers.

 #Password Strength Evaluation 
To better understand what makes a password strong or weak, I tested six different passwords on popular password strength checker tools like PasswordMeter, Bitwarden, NordPass, and Kaspersky. Below are my findings in plain English:

1.password123

Result: Very Weak (18%)
Why: This is a commonly used password that combines a dictionary word with a basic number pattern. It lacks symbols and complexity. Easily guessable in brute-force and dictionary attacks.

2.Password@123

Result: Good (67%)
Why: This one includes uppercase, lowercase, a symbol, and numbers. While stronger than the previous, it still follows a predictable pattern often seen in breached passwords.

3.Blu3$kY_2025!

Result: Strong (90%)
Why: This password has everything — mixed cases, numbers, special characters, and a good length. It’s hard to guess and passes most strength checks with flying colors.

4.MyDogIs$Named#42

Result: Very Strong (95%)
Why: A creative passphrase that’s long, contains a mix of characters, and is unique. It’s easier to remember yet incredibly hard for bots to crack.

5.abcABC123!@#

Result: Good (78%)
Why: A solid structure with all character types. However, its pattern (lowercase-uppercase-numbers-symbols) is commonly used, which slightly reduces its strength.

6.@Sk8Tr#p9qZL!

Result: Very Strong (97%)
Why: A highly randomized password using symbols, digits, and mixed-case letters in a way that shows no obvious pattern. Excellent entropy and resistance to attacks.

#Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
1.Use at least 12 characters in your password.
2.Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3.Avoid using dictionary words or predictable patterns like 123 or abc.
4.Consider using passphrases: combinations of unrelated words (e.g., Correct$Horse#Battery%Staple).
5.Don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
6.Use a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.

 Research Summary: Password Attacks
1. Brute Force Attack
Attacker tries every possible character combination.
Long, complex passwords take exponentially more time to crack.

2. Dictionary Attack
Attacker uses a precompiled list of common passwords and words.
Avoid dictionary words to prevent fast cracking.

3. Credential Stuffing
Uses leaked username-password pairs to break into other accounts.
Reusing passwords increases vulnerability.

Why Password Strength Matters:
1.Length increases resistance to brute force attacks.
2.Complexity (symbols, numbers) raises entropy, making guessing harder.
3.Uniqueness reduces the impact of breaches or leaks.
4.Strong passwords reduce the need for frequent resets or account recovery.

#Password Managers & MFA
1.Password Managers (e.g., Bitwarden, LastPass) help you store complex passwords securely.
2.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring something you have or are in addition to something you know

Conclusion
This task helped me understand that password security isn't just about complexity, but also about length, unpredictability, and usage habits. Using strong, unique passwords along with MFA and password managers significantly reduces the risk of compromise.
